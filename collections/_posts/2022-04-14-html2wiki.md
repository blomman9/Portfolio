In the ever-evolving world of web development and content creation, two formatting languages have gained widespread popularity: HTML and Markdown. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages, defining their structure and content. On the other hand, Markdown is a lightweight markup language known for its simplicity and readability. In this blog post, we will demystify the process of converting HTML to Markdown, offering insights and examples that bridge the gap between these two formats. Whether you're a web developer, content creator, or someone curious about the intricacies of web technologies, understanding HTML to Markdown conversion can be a valuable skill to add to your toolkit.


Examples of HTML Snippets Converted to Markdown:

HTML Headings:

    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>

Markdown:

```
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
```

HTML Links:

    <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>

    <li>Second item</li>
    </ol>

If you like me have your own Wiki site. You might want to consider adopting the [Html2Wiki] script I conjured over a few years. It helps with simple formatting from HTML to Markdown.

It supports Pandoc through an optional [pandoc-php] wrapper, if you use Pandoc there are [many examples] of additional input and output types.
